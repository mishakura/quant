MSV:
MSV (Minimum Semi-Variance) measures only the variance of negative returns — i.e., 
the variability of returns below the mean or below a target.
Mathematically, it’s like variance but replaces squared deviations with squared negative deviations only.
It squares those negative deviations before averaging them.
That squaring step is key — it means big losses count a lot more than small ones.



FSLP:
It looks only at the returns below a target (for example, 0% or the average return)
and calculates the average shortfall — how far below that target you fall when you lose.
How far below 0% are they? → 1%, 3%, 2%.
FLPM = (1 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 2%
So your average loss when you lose is 2%.

SLPM
Like FLPM, but squares the shortfalls to punish large ones more heavily.


CVaR:
CVaR calculates the average loss in the worst α fraction of cases (e.g. worst 5%).  

VaR:
VaR gives you the exact loss value at:
95% confidence → roughly 1.65 standard deviations below the mean
99% confidence → roughly 2.33 standard deviations below the mea
(You can choose the %confidence)


MDD – Maximum Drawdown
The largest drop from a peak to a trough in the asset’s price
If MDD is the risk measure:
Assets with larger MDD → considered riskier → get less weight
Assets with smaller MDD → considered safer → get more weight

CDaR 
Compute all drawdowns for an asset or portfolio:
Example: portfolio goes $100 → $90 → $80 → $95
Drawdowns: -10% (from 100 → 90), -20% (100 → 80)
Pick a confidence level, e.g., 95%
Identify the worst 5% of drawdowns
CDaR = average of those worst drawdowns

EDaR
EDaR measures all drawdowns, but weights the big ones more 
heavily — giving a smooth, tail-sensitive measure of 
downside risk, and assets with higher EDaR get lower weights in HRP.

UCi
The depth and duration of drawdowns from past peaks.
Portfolio A drops 20% but recovers in a week.
Portfolio B drops 10% and stays low for 6 months.
B has a higher UCI because it causes more prolonged stress.

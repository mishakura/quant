"""52-week-high momentum: The 52-week-high portfolio takes long (short)
positions in stocks whose current price is close to (far from) the 52-week
high. The distance from the 52-week high is measured by the price of
the stock one month ago divided by the 52-week high in the previous
year. So if we are standing on December 31, 2015, we divide the price on
November 30, 2015, by the 52-week high November 30, 2014–2015"""
